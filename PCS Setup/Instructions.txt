I wasn't able to solve the problem regarding the oracle service name for different systems. 
But I have made the code more flexible now and you just need to change the service name in the
splash form instead of renaming in all the 24-25 forms. All other forms take the data string from
the splash form directly or indirectly.
Please rename the oralce service name in the connection string belonging to the splash screen and
test the software.!!
